  Retail investing has grown at a startling rate over the past 5 years. It’s share of trading volume has nearly doubled from the last decade from between 10 and 15% to 25%. Many of these investors lack experience in investing and often have an unhealthy amount of their net worth tied up in just few investments. While this has paid off for some who have benefited from the outstanding rise in stocks like GameStop and AMC as well many crypto currencies, many other American’s have lost large portions of their net worth to single investments. Yet, most stock predictors and evaluators tend to focus on average case for a stock. Even the few that recognize conservative returns don’t take into consideration worst case scenarios for investments. 
  
  A natural 1 is phrase taken from culture of Dungeons and Dragons. It refers to a player rolling a 20-sided die and the roll resulting in a one. This roll usually has detrimental effects on the player. In popular culture it used to describe extremely unlucky occurrences despite whatever one’s skillset might be. The odds also match up with many interesting statistical numbers since it represents a 5% chance of happening. 5% is often a threshold of significance in many statistical studies. The goal of this project will be to explore the ramifications of extremely unfortunate turns in stock market prices.
